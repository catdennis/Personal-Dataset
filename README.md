# Personal-Dataset
Motivation:
I first set out to answer the question of how do the preseason predictions for ranking compare to the current season statistics of the current ranking. Once I started pulling data from the prmeier league, I found that the more interesting data for me was the how the defence and offenmce ranking effect premier league standings.
