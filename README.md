## Motivation
Soccer has always been my favorite sport growing up. I loved to play it, I loved to watch, and when I realized it could become part of a field I love, that being statistics, I instanlty took intrest in analyzing premier league statistics. I first set out to answer the question of how do the preseason predictions for ranking compare to the current season rankings. Once I started pulling data from the FiveThirtyEight prediction tables, I found that the more interesting data for me was the how the defence and offence ranking effect premier league standings. When looking at the data they seemed to be calculated in different ways, whch made me curous as two how they calculated these numbers, and why they are based on such a small point scale. For this project I have decided to pull Offense and deffense rankings for all premier league teams fro the pre-season and current season stats to see the accuracy, the change, and the wieght these rankin ghold when it comes to the actual results of the game.
